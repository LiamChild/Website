          introduced into service by the State Rail Authority, before later
          being operated under CityRail and Sydney Trains. A total of 56
          carriages were built, with the last sets being withdrawn from service
          in February 2021, having been gradually replaced by A & B set trains.

          until 2019. Originally entering service under the Public Transport
          Commission, the sets also operated under the State Rail Authority,
          CityRail and Sydney Trains. Prior to their retirement, the S sets were
          the last class in the Sydney Trains fleet to not be air-conditioned,
          earning them the nicknames "Tin cans" and "Sweat Sets". They were also
          nicknamed "Ridgys" because of their fluted ("ridged") stainless steel
          panelling; they shared this nickname with similar looking K sets and C
          sets. Their stainless steel appearance was also shared with the
          intercity V sets and U sets. All remaining sets were withdrawn from
          service in June 2019.

        <p><strong>Class:</strong> Bradfield Stock</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Info:</strong> The New South Wales Bradfield suburban carriage
          stock, also known as the "Bradfield Cars," were the first electric
          train suburban carriages used by the New South Wales Government
          Railways (NSWGR) in Sydney, Australia. These carriages were introduced
          in the late 1920s and early 1930s as part of the electrification of
          the Sydney suburban rail network.
        </p>

        <p>
          Named after Dr. John Bradfield, the chief engineer behind the Sydney
          Harbour Bridge and the city's electrification project, these carriages
          were designed to be robust and suitable for high-frequency urban
          service. The Bradfield Cars featured steel construction and were
          initially fitted with timber interiors. They were recognizable by
          their distinctive "dog box" design, with separate compartments and no
          central corridor.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Bradfield suburban carriage stock remained in service until the
          1970s, when they were gradually phased out and replaced by more modern
          rolling stock. Some of these carriages have been preserved by railway
          heritage organizations and are occasionally displayed at transport
          museums or during special heritage events.

        <p>
          <strong>Info:</strong> The 620 and 720 rail cars are Australian
          suburban electric multiple units (EMUs) used primarily by the New
          South Wales Government Railways (now part of Sydney Trains). The 620
          class, built between 1961 and 1968, were designed for short- to
          medium-distance travel, featuring a diesel-mechanical design with
          two-car sets comprising a driving motor and trailer car. The 720 class
          is essentially the same as the 620 class, with differences mainly in
          the interiors and intended uses. Both classes served in various
          regional and suburban services, particularly on the Hunter and
          Illawarra lines, and were known for their reliability and simplicity,
          contributing to their long service life, with some units remaining
          operational into the early 2000s.

        <p><strong>Class:</strong> 660 and 760 Railcars</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Info:</strong>
          The NSW 660 and 760 rail cars were a series of diesel multiple units
          (DMUs) operated by the New South Wales Government Railways in
          Australia. Introduced between 1961 and 1965, these rail cars were
          designed to provide regional and rural passenger services across the
          state. The 660 class rail cars featured two-engine configurations,
          while the 760 class had a similar design but with different seating
          arrangements and internal fittings to accommodate various service
          requirements. Both classes were known for their reliability and were
          used extensively on branch lines until they were gradually phased out
          in the late 1980s and early 1990s due to modernization efforts and the
          introduction of newer rolling stock.

        <p>
          <strong>Info:</strong>The NSW Tulloch Trailers, also known as the
          Tulloch Rail Trailers, were a series of passenger carriages built by
          Tulloch Limited for the New South Wales Government Railways (NSWGR) in
          Australia during the 1950s and 1960s. These carriages were distinctive
          for their lightweight aluminum construction, which made them more
          fuel-efficient and reduced track wear compared to their steel
          counterparts. They were primarily used on suburban and interurban
          routes, providing increased comfort and reliability to passengers with
          their improved seating and amenities. Despite their eventual
          replacement by newer rolling stock, the Tulloch Trailers played a
          significant role in modernizing the NSWGR fleet and enhancing the
          overall commuter experience in New South Wales during their period of
          service.

          <strong>Info:</strong> The NSW Silver City Comet was a distinctive
          rail service in New South Wales, Australia, that operated from 1937 to
          1989. Named after the "Silver City," Broken Hill, the train was the
          first fully air-conditioned diesel-powered train in the Southern
          Hemisphere and was recognized for its distinctive silver color. It
          provided a vital link between Parkes, in central New South Wales, and
          Broken Hill, running through remote and sparsely populated areas.
          Renowned for its comfort and reliability, the Silver City Comet was a
          significant advancement in Australian railway history, offering
          passengers a faster and more comfortable journey compared to the steam
          locomotives of its time. The service was eventually discontinued in
          1989 due to declining passenger numbers and the rising costs of
          operation, but it remains a celebrated part of Australian rail
          heritage.
